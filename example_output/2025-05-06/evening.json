This incident occurred in an area facing the disputed Scarborough Shoal, which has been the site of increasing tensions between China and the Philippines. The USS Brattleboro, which participated in crucial battles during World War II, sank at 7:20 AM local time on Monday, April 28, 2025. The ship, designated as a submarine chaser, served in important roles in the Battle of Leyte and the invasion of Okinawa. Despite the ship's age and unsuitability for normal operations, it was selected as the target for the MARSTRIKE exercise. The Philippine and US joint task forces will still achieve their training objectives, as other elements of the exercise were still scheduled to occur. The Philippine military stated that there was no environmental danger from the sinking, as the vessel had been cleaned before being towed out for the exercise. This event highlights the importance of maintaining and preserving historical military assets while also addressing the challenges posed by the potential risks involved in using such assets for military exercises.","keyTakeAways":["A former World War II-era US ship was scheduled to be used as a target in the US-Philippine joint military drills, but it unexpectedly sank before it could be

This incident, which began on April 28, 2025, involved the Philadelphia Terminal Radar Approach Control, which lost radar and communications with planes under their control, unable to see, hear, or talk to them. The FAA acknowledged that the ‘antiquated air traffic control system’ is the cause of the problem and committed to updating its automated system to be more resilient. Approximately 45 days of leave were taken by FAA employees due to the trauma of the incident. The controllers were essentially left in the dark as they lost access to systems that help them guide planes into Newark, with some pilots experiencing panic and confusion. The situation has been exacerbated by over 20% of FAA controllers who walked off the job at Newark Airport during the week. The FAA has pledged to implement a new system that could take up to four years to get working, and the agency has also indicated it expects more delays at the airport. The incident has prompted a call for a deep look into the issues at Newark Airport and is viewed as a warning of potential problems across the nation. The controllers affected by the incident, and many of the affected flights, have been through United Airlines flights, and the control facility responsible for traffic at Newark has been 'chronically understaffed for years,' according to United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby. The controller's union noted that the controllers took absence under the Federal Employees Compensation Act due to the traumatic event, and the FAA has also stated that it is working to safeguard telecommunications equipment in the New York area.","keyTakeAways":["Air traffic controllers lost communication with aircraft at Newark Liberty International Airport, leading to hundreds of delays for

This victory marks the first time a Chinese player has achieved this honor. Zhao overcame a 11-6 overnight deficit to secure victory, becoming the first amateur to win the world title. The tournament took a unique twist when Zhao received a 20-month ban due to a match-fixing scandal in January 2023, leading to his classification as an amateur and the need for qualifying through four rounds to reach the Crucible. Despite facing a spirited comeback attempt from Williams, Zhao's tenacity and skill proved decisive, securing the championship. His win is particularly significant as it represents a remarkable comeback for a player who had been sidelined for two years due to the ban. Additionally, the event saw Williams, at the age of 50, become the oldest player to reach the World Snooker Championship final, and Judd Trump, the current world number 1, narrowly missed out on a record fourth title. The victory adds to Zhao's status as one of the rising stars of snooker and brings joy to the Chinese snooker community.","keyTakeAways":["Zhao Xintong, 28, became the first Chinese player to win the World Snooker Championship."],"namedEntities":[{"name":"Zhao Xintong","whatIsThisEntity":"Chinese player who won the World Snooker Championship, and the subject of the article.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"He is the main figure in the article, showcasing his comeback from a ban to win a prestigious championship."},{"name":"Mark Williams","whatIsThisEntity":"Welsh snooker player, who played against Zhao in the final and became the oldest player to reach the final.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"He is a key player in the match that Zhao won, and his story highlights the competitiveness of the sport."},{"name":"Terry Griffiths","whatIsThisEntity":"A qualifier who won the World Snooker Championship before Zhao.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"He provides context to Zhao's achievement, showing other players from China who have previously won the tournament."},{"name":"Shaun Murphy","whatIsThisEntity":"Another qualifier who won the World Snooker Championship before Zhao.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"He provides another example of a Chinese player's success at the World Snooker Championship."},{"name":"World Snooker Championship","whatIsThisEntity":"A prestigious professional snooker tournament held annually at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, UK.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"It is the main event Zhao Xintong won, and it is the focus of the article's coverage."},{"name":"Crucible Theatre","whatIsThisEntity":"A historic venue in Sheffield, UK, where the World Snooker Championship is held.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"It is the location of the tournament where Zhao Xintong won."},{"name":"Ronnie O'Sullivan","whatIsThisEntity":"A seven-time World Snooker Championship winner.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"His involvement in the tournament shows the competitiveness and high standards of the sport."},{"name":"Terry Griffiths","whatIsThisEntity":"A qualifier who won the World Snooker Championship before Zhao.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"He is included in the list of qualifiers who won the tournament, highlighting Zhao's achievement."},{"name":"Shaun Murphy","whatIsThisEntity":"A qualifier who won the World Snooker Championship before Zhao.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"He is included in the list of qualifiers who won the tournament, showing other Chinese players' success in the event."},{"name":"Judd Trump","whatIsThisEntity":"The current world number 1 in snooker.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"He is mentioned in relation to Williams' semi-final victory, emphasizing the competitive landscape of the tournament."}],"importantDates":[{"dateMentionedInArticle":"2023-01-01","descriptionOfWhyDateIsRelevant":"The date when Zhao Xintong was banned for 20 months due to a match-fixing scandal."},{"dateMentionedInArticle":"2025-04-07","descriptionOfWhyDateIsRelevant":"The start of Zhao's grueling qualifying run to reach the Crucible."},{"dateMentionedInArticle":"2025-05-05","descriptionOfWhyDateIsRelevant":"The date of the latest update about Zhao Xintong's victory at the World Snooker Championship."}],"importantTimeframes":[{"approximateTimeFrameStart":"2025-04-07","approximateTimeFrameEnd":"2025-05-05","descriptionOfWhyTimeFrameIsRelevant":"The timeframe when Zhao Xintong competed in the qualifiers and made it to the Crucible."},{"approximateTimeFrameStart":"2025-04-07","approximateTimeFrameEnd":"2023-01-01","descriptionOfWhyTimeFrameIsRelevant":"The timeframe during which Zhao Xintong was banned for 20 months due to a match-fixing scandal."}]},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/05/us/san-diego-panga-boat-capsized","dateOfPublication":"2025-05-05","timeOfPublication":"19:46:00+00:00","title":"3 dead, 4 hurt, 7 missing after panga boat capsizes off San Diego, authorities say","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A small boat overturned in the ocean near San Diego, resulting in three deaths, four injuries, and seven missing persons.

The prison, which has a storied history dating back to the 1850s and became a maximum-security facility in 1934, is set to be a symbol of 'Law, Order, and Justice.' Although the National Park Service manages Alcatraz as a popular tourist destination and historic landmark, current officials and the public generally oppose the President's plan to rebuild and reopen the prison. The prison's closure in 1963 was due to high maintenance costs and deteriorating infrastructure, which now requires millions to restore.

was photographed using is investigating a hack","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A phone app called TeleMessage, which was reportedly used by former U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz, has had its services suspended due to a security incident. The app, which preserves and organizes messages sent via Signal and other mobile apps, is now under investigation. A spokesperson for TeleMessage’s parent company, Smarsh, stated that all TeleMessage services have been temporarily suspended due to 'a recent security incident.' The extent of the hack is not clear, and there was no immediate response from TeleMessage regarding the data that may have been taken. TeleMessage, an app acquired by Smarsh in 2021, was used by Waltz, who is currently serving as a national security adviser under President Donald Trump. The suspension of TeleMessage services has raised concerns about the use of a potentially compromised app for sensitive communications. Joshua Steinman, a former cyber official at the National Security Council, commented that Waltz's use of the app could be a 'juicy intel target' for foreign powers, indicating potential intelligence risk.

While passports remain an acceptable alternative for international travel, the REAL ID Act mandates that domestic air travel, access to federal facilities, and boarding aircraft will require a compliant identification. TSA, the Transportation Security Administration, is encouraging compliance among travelers and is working with various stakeholders to facilitate this transition. TSA has begun a public awareness campaign and is committed to enforcing the REAL ID regulations from the start of May 7. While some states are meeting the requirements faster than others, the costs and documentation requirements vary from place to place, with some states imposing additional requirements. For example, in Washington, DC, a REAL ID costs $47, while Pennsylvania charges a one-time $30 REAL ID fee and a $39.50 fee for drivers seeking a renewal, totaling $69.50 for a renewal.

The Justice Department claims there's no one currently in Pennsylvania planned for removal under the Alien Enemies Act.

The research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, combined satellite data, seismic activity, and computer models to uncover the cause of the volcano's unrest. It revealed that magma, gases, and briny fluids were interacting within a hydrothermal network, not surging magma, leading to quakes, steam release, and volcano deformation. The study found that as the magma body heated subterranean liquid and released gases, the gas and liquid migrated upward and collected in chambers below the volcanic crater. The findings suggest that Uturuncu's activity is not a sign of an imminent eruption, but rather a 'zombie' volcano degassing, letting off steam. The research has implications for understanding volcanoes, identifying potential targets for geothermal energy, and accessing minerals essential for technology. The study was conducted using multiple techniques, including seismic activity, rock chemistry, and physics analysis, to create a clearer picture of the volcano's internal structure.","keyTakeAways":["Scientists have explored the anatomy of a 'zombie volcano,' which is Uturuncu, a mountain in the Central Andes range, showing signs of activity without erupting for over 250,000 years."],"namedEntities":[{"name":"Uturuncu","whatIsThisEntity":"A  lofty peak in the Central Andes mountain range, a ‘zombie volcano’ with signs of activity.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"Uturuncu is the main subject of the study, highlighting the ongoing research about a dormant volcano showing signs of activity."},{"name":"Mindy Weisberger","whatIsThisEntity":"The author of the article.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"She is the primary source of information for this news article."},{"name":"Magma Body","whatIsThisEntity":"A vast reservoir of magma lying beneath Uturuncu, a part of the Altiplano-Puna Magma Body.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"It's a key element in understanding the activity at Uturuncu and the interaction between magma and fluids."},{"name":"Zombie Volcano","whatIsThisEntity":"Uturuncu, and other similar dormant volcanoes.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"It's a key term used to describe Uturuncu, which is the central subject of the study and the focal point of this article."},{"name":"Seismic Events","whatIsThisEntity":"More than 1,700 seismic events between 2009 and 2012.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"They were used to produce high-resolution images of the shallow crust under Uturuncu and to reveal details about the volcano's inner workings."},{"name":"Hydrothermal Network","whatIsThisEntity":"A system of interacting magma, gases, and briny fluids.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"It's the key system discovered to be causing the volcano's unrest and activity."},{"name":"Magma Chamber","whatIsThisEntity":"A subsurface pocket of magma that could potentially erupt through vents and fissures.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"It's the primary source of volcanic activity, and the study found that Uturuncu's activity is linked to this chamber."},{"name":"Altiplano-Puna Magma Body","whatIsThisEntity":"A vast reservoir of magma spanning roughly 124 miles (200 kilometers) beneath Uturuncu.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"It's described as the biggest known active magma body in the planet's crust, and its interaction with the hydrothermal network is key to understanding Uturuncu's activity."},{"name":"Geothermal Energy","whatIsThisEntity":"Potential energy source that zombie volcanoes like Uturuncu could be explored as.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"The study suggests that investigating Uturuncu could lead to the exploration of geothermal energy sources in other zombie volcanoes."}],"importantDates":[{"dateMentionedInArticle":"2025-04-28","descriptionOfWhyDateIsRelevant":"The date of the study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences."},{"dateMentionedInArticle":"2025-05-05","descriptionOfWhyDateIsRelevant":"The date when the article was updated and CNN republished the news."},{"dateMentionedInArticle":"2025-04-26","descriptionOfWhyDateIsRelevant":"The date when the satellite radar imagery was taken of Uturuncu, the tallest mountain in southwestern Bolivia."}],"importantTimeframes":[{"approximateTimeFrameStart":"2025-04-26","approximateTimeFrameEnd":"2025-04-28","descriptionOfWhyTimeFrameIsRelevant":"The time frame when the study was conducted and analyzed, leading to the findings published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences."},{"approximateTimeFrameStart":"2025-04-26","approximateTimeFrameEnd":"2025-05-05","descriptionOfWhyTimeFrameIsRelevant":"The time frame when the CNN article was updated and republished, keeping the information current."},{"approximateTimeFrameStart":"2025-04-26","approximateTimeFrameEnd":"2025-04-28","descriptionOfWhyTimeFrameIsRelevant":"The time frame when the satellite imagery was taken and the subsequent research began, focusing on understanding Uturuncu's activity."}]},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/05/business/skechers-shoes-3g-capital","dateOfPublication":"2025-05-05","timeOfPublication":"15:59:00-04:00","title":"Skechers is going private during the middle of a trade war","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Skechers, a shoe company based in Southern California with 5,300 US stores, is planning to go private by being purchased by investment firm 3G Capital for $9.4 billion. CEO Robert Greenberg of Skechers stated in a statement that the company is entering 'its next chapter in partnership with the global investment firm 3G Capital.' The move to go private comes amid a trade war during which President Trump's tariffs have heavily impacted the footwear industry. Skechers' stock jumped 25% on the news of the acquisition. The company is getting off the public market due to the influence of tariffs, which have made it more attractive to be taken private.

The analysis, led by Dr. Jamie Lo, an obstetrician at Oregon Health & Science University, and published in JAMA Pediatrics, analyzed 51 studies with over 21 million participants. The findings indicate that use of marijuana during pregnancy is associated with a 52% higher risk of preterm delivery before 37 weeks and a 75% higher risk of low birth weight. The study also found a 29% higher risk of infant death associated with the use of marijuana during pregnancy. Despite the potential harms, marijuana use during pregnancy is rising, and there is a misconception that it is harmless due to its natural origins. The new research suggests that as more studies are conducted with consistent results, there is more certainty that there is an association between prenatal exposure to cannabis and adverse birth outcomes.

This issue has been particularly problematic at busy Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, where staffing issues have led to major delays for an unprecedented seventh day in a row. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Sunday implemented a Ground Delay Program and flights were delayed an average of almost four hours Sunday evening. The reasons for these delays include a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, a walk-off by Newark air traffic controllers, the closure of a runway for rehabilitation work, and technology failures caused by outdated equipment. Newark Airport's control facility responsible for traffic has been 'chronically understaffed for years,' and the shortage is at its lowest point in nearly 30 years. The FAA is using delays to slow the number of flights so the system remains safe, and the President is calling for Congress to provide the resources needed to upgrade the technology. The controllers union, flight attendants, and airlines are calling for more air traffic controllers and better technology to mitigate the delays and ensure safety for travelers.","keyTakeAways":["Newark Liberty International Airport has experienced unprecedented seven days of major delays, with flights delayed an average of almost four hours on Sunday evening, according to the FAA advisory."],"namedEntities":[{"name":"Chris Boyette","whatIsThisEntity":"CNN reporter","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"He is the author of the article detailing the delays at Newark Airport."},{"name":"Pete Muntean","whatIsThisEntity":"CNN reporter","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"He is another author of the article detailing the delays at Newark Airport."},{"name":"Zoe Sottile","whatIsThisEntity":"CNN reporter","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"She is the author of the article detailing the delays at Newark Airport."},{"name":"Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)","whatIsThisEntity":"Regulatory body in charge of air traffic control","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"It implemented the Ground Delay Program to mitigate delays at Newark Airport."},{"name":"Newark Liberty International Airport","whatIsThisEntity":"Bustling airport in New Jersey","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"It experienced a historic seventh day of major delays due to staffing issues."},{"name":"United Airlines","whatIsThisEntity":"Major airline","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"It delayed 232 flights and canceled 35 more due to Newark Airport's delays."},{"name":"Sean Duffy","whatIsThisEntity":"Transportation Secretary","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"He pledged to implement a new, state-of-the-art system to replace outdated air traffic control equipment."},{"name":"National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA)","whatIsThisEntity":"Union representing air traffic controllers","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"They claim Newark airport is chronically understaffed and has a staffing shortage of over 20%."},{"name":"United Airlines CEO","whatIsThisEntity":"Scott Kirby","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"He suggested the delays were caused by technology failures and a walk-off by Newark air traffic controllers."},{"name":"Transportation Secretary","whatIsThisEntity":"Sean Duffy","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"He announced a new system for air traffic control facilities across the country that would be the envy of the world, but it might take three to four years to implement."},{"name":"President Donald Trump","whatIsThisEntity":"US President","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"He is fully on board with the plan to replace the systems and is calling on Congress for resources."},{"name":"Air traffic controller shortage","whatIsThisEntity":"Shortage in the number of certified air traffic controllers","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"It has led to significant delays at airports nationwide, including Newark Airport."},{"name":"Nick Daniels","whatIsThisEntity":"President of the controllers union","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"He testified before Congress about the nationwide air traffic controller shortage and its impact on Newark Airport."},{"name":"Sara Nelson","whatIsThisEntity":"President of the AFA-CWA (Association of Flight Attendants-CWA)","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"She called on airlines to reduce flights due to the staffing shortage, suggesting a potential impact on Newark Airport's operations."},{"name":"Chris Rocheleau","whatIsThisEntity":"FAA Acting Administrator","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"He spoke about the FAA's response to technology failures and staffing shortages at Newark Airport."}],"importantDates":[{"dateMentionedInArticle":"2025-05-05","descriptionOfWhyDateIsRelevant":"The date when the CNN article was updated and published."}],"importantTimeframes":[{"approximateTimeFrameStart":"Now","approximateTimeFrameEnd":"2025-05-05","descriptionOfWhyTimeFrameIsRelevant":"The time period in which the delays were ongoing and the article was updated."},{"approximateTimeFrameStart":"2017-01-20","approximateTimeFrameEnd":"2022-12-31","descriptionOfWhyTimeFrameIsRelevant":"The time frame when the air traffic controller shortage has been an ongoing issue, leading to these recent delays."}]},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/05/asia/japan-child-population-fall-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-05-05","timeOfPublication":"12:20:00-13:20","title":"Children aged 14 or younger now make up less than 12% of this country’s population","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Japan's estimated child population has decreased for the 44th straight year, standing at a record low of 13.66 million children aged 14 and under as of April 1, 2025, representing just 11.1% of the total population of 123.4 million.

In court, the man explained he had been waiting for a safe place to pull off the highway. But that single dismissed charge has now upended his life. His student visa registration allowed him to continue his training and work. That was abruptly terminated last month, forcing him to resign from his first job at the Florida Department of Revenue. The man, who has joined a lawsuit with other international students, believes his troubles began with a minor traffic violation a few years ago and was forced to resign from his job. Starting in March, officials at ICE ran the names of more than 1 million international students through the National Crime Information Center, a federal database that tracks crime-related information. ICE came up with about 6,400 likely hits and then used that data to terminate thousands of SEVIS records. The problem, immigration lawyers say, is that many of those hits were for minor brushes with the law, including traffic offenses, or cases where charges were later dropped or dismissed by police and courts.

Microsoft, which owns Skype, announced in February that the service would be available until May 5 and urged users to switch to the free version of Microsoft Teams, its communication platform with video call capabilities. Microsoft claims Skype users can automatically migrate all of their chats and contacts to Teams. However, the user base has been dwindling in recent years due to competition from other video calling and messaging alternatives such as Zoom, WhatsApp, and Slack. The service has been available since 2003, founded by Niklas Zennström and Janus Friis, who began with offering phone calls over the internet. By 2005, eBay had acquired Skype for $2.6 billion, which later was sold to a group of investors in 2009, who in turn sold Skype to Microsoft. Despite its decline, Microsoft suggests that users can migrate their accounts to Teams, making the transition seamless.","keyTakeAways":["Skype, the pioneer of online video calling, will shut down completely on 2025-05-05.","Skype users can migrate all chats and contacts to Microsoft's Teams platform."],"namedEntities":[{"name":"Skype","whatIsThisEntity":"The video calling service that is shutting down.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"It is the central focus of the article detailing its impending shutdown."},{"name":"Niklas Zennström","whatIsThisEntity":"One of the founders of Skype.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"He is credited with founding Skype in 2003."},{"name":"Janus Friis","whatIsThisEntity":"The co-founder of Skype.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"He is credited with founding Skype in 2003."},{"name":"Microsoft","whatIsThisEntity":"The company that owns and plans to shut down Skype.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"It is the entity responsible for the announcement and future migration of users to its platform."},{"name":"Jeff Teper","whatIsThisEntity":"Microsoft's president of collaborative apps and platforms.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"He made a statement in a blog post about Skype's future, reflecting on its history and service to users."},{"name":"Microsoft Teams","whatIsThisEntity":"Microsoft's communication platform with video calling capabilities.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"It is the platform Microsoft has suggested users switch to as an alternative for their video calling needs."},{"name":"Niklas Zennström","whatIsThisEntity":"One of the founders of Skype.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"He is a key figure in the history of Skype's founding and growth."},{"name":"Janus Friis","whatIsThisEntity":"The co-founder of Skype.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"He is a key figure in the history of Skype's founding and growth."},{"name":"2025-05-05","whatIsThisEntity":"The date Skype will shut down.","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"It marks the end of Skype's service."}],"importantDates":[{"dateMentionedInArticle":"2025-05-05","descriptionOfWhyDateIsRelevant":"The key event marked by the shutdown announcement of Skype."}],"importantTimeframes":[{"approximateTimeFrameStart":"2020","approximateTimeFrameEnd":"2025-05-05","descriptionOfWhyTimeFrameIsRelevant":"The timeframe during which Skype's user base has been decreasing."}]},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-64239","dateOfPublication":"2025-05-04","timeOfPublication":"10:58:00-20:58","title":"Does a president need to uphold the Constitution?
