### Summary

A 1944 World War II-era US ship, the ex-USS Brattleboro, was scheduled to be used as the main target in the US-Philippine joint military drills, but it unexpectedly sank before the exercise could take place. This incident occurred in an area facing the disputed Scarborough Shoal, which has been the site of increasing tensions between China and the Philippines. The USS Brattleboro, which participated in crucial battles during World War II, sank at 7:20 AM local time on Monday, April 28, 2025. The ship, designated as a submarine chaser, served in important roles in the Battle of Leyte and the invasion of Okinawa. Despite the ship's age and unsuitability for normal operations, it was selected as the target for the MARSTRIKE exercise. The Philippine and US joint task forces will still achieve their training objectives, as other elements of the exercise were still scheduled to occur. The Philippine military stated that there was no environmental danger from the sinking, as the vessel had been cleaned before being towed out for the exercise. This event highlights the importance of maintaining and preserving historical military assets while also addressing the challenges posed by the potential risks involved in using such assets for military exercises.

## Air traffic controllers lost communication with Newark planes – leading to widespread delays after they took leave for trauma

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/05/us/newark-airport-additional-flight-delays)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 12:18:00-20:18_

### Summary

Air traffic controllers at Newark Liberty International Airport lost communication with aircraft, leading to widespread delays and cancellations over a period of more than a week. This incident, which began on April 28, 2025, involved the Philadelphia Terminal Radar Approach Control, which lost radar and communications with planes under their control, unable to see, hear, or talk to them. The FAA acknowledged that the ‘antiquated air traffic control system’ is the cause of the problem and committed to updating its automated system to be more resilient. Approximately 45 days of leave were taken by FAA employees due to the trauma of the incident. The controllers were essentially left in the dark as they lost access to systems that help them guide planes into Newark, with some pilots experiencing panic and confusion. The situation has been exacerbated by over 20% of FAA controllers who walked off the job at Newark Airport during the week. The FAA has pledged to implement a new system that could take up to four years to get working, and the agency has also indicated it expects more delays at the airport. The incident has prompted a call for a deep look into the issues at Newark Airport and is viewed as a warning of potential problems across the nation. The controllers affected by the incident, and many of the affected flights, have been through United Airlines flights, and the control facility responsible for traffic at Newark has been 'chronically understaffed for years,' according to United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby. The controller's union noted that the controllers took absence under the Federal Employees Compensation Act due to the traumatic event, and the FAA has also stated that it is working to safeguard telecommunications equipment in the New York area.

### Key Takeaways
  - Air traffic controllers lost communication with aircraft at Newark Liberty International Airport, leading to hundreds of delays for more than a week.
  - The controllers in Philadelphia Terminal Radar Approach Control lost radar and communications with the aircraft under their control, unable to see, hear, or talk to them.
  - About 15 to 20 flights were being controlled by Newark airport controllers when communications and radar went down on Monday.
  - The FAA acknowledged the 'antiquated air traffic control system' and promised to implement a new system that could take up to four years to get working.
  - The FAA stated it will train new controllers to handle the busy airspace once the old system is updated.
  - The incident has prompted the FAA to update its automated system and safeguard telecommunications equipment in the New York area.
  - The FAA has indicated it expects more delays at the airport.
  - The controllers in Philadelphia Terminal Radar Approach Control took special government leave for trauma as a result of the incident.
  - Some controllers have been fired due to cuts by the Trump administration, which has had little response to the FAA's issues.

## Trump’s order to reopen Alcatraz is the perfect metaphor for his second term

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/06/politics/alcatraz-reopening-trump-second-term-metaphor)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 12:00:00-20:00_

### Summary

The article analyzes President Trump's decision to reopen Alcatraz as a federal prison, framing it as a quintessential Trumpian idea. The author, Stephen Collinson, argues that reopening Alcatraz aligns with Trump's image as a strongman and his attempts to mock political correctness. The article highlights how Trump uses this historical site as a metaphor for his leadership style, contrasting it with other proposed facilities like the Supermax prison. The article also notes the political implications of the decision, as it has drawn criticism from figures like Nancy Pelosi. Despite the potential impracticality of the plan and legal challenges, Trump seems to view it as a way to draw attention and reinforce his image as a leader. The article suggests that Trump's theatrical approach often backfires, but in this case, it seems to be working, particularly with his base.

## Zhao Xintong becomes China’s first world snooker champion after comeback from ban

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/05/sport/china-zhao-xintong-snooker-champion-intl-hnk-spt)
- _Published: 2025-05-05 17:59:00-20:59_

### Summary

Zhao Xintong, the 28-year-old Chinese player, triumphed over Welsh snooker legend Mark Williams at the Crucible Theatre to win the World Snooker Championship. This victory marks the first time a Chinese player has achieved this honor. Zhao overcame a 11-6 overnight deficit to secure victory, becoming the first amateur to win the world title. The tournament took a unique twist when Zhao received a 20-month ban due to a match-fixing scandal in January 2023, leading to his classification as an amateur and the need for qualifying through four rounds to reach the Crucible. Despite facing a spirited comeback attempt from Williams, Zhao's tenacity and skill proved decisive, securing the championship. His win is particularly significant as it represents a remarkable comeback for a player who had been sidelined for two years due to the ban. Additionally, the event saw Williams, at the age of 50, become the oldest player to reach the World Snooker Championship final, and Judd Trump, the current world number 1, narrowly missed out on a record fourth title. The victory adds to Zhao's status as one of the rising stars of snooker and brings joy to the Chinese snooker community.

### Key Takeaways

## Trump wants to reopen one of America’s most notorious prisons. Here’s how Alcatraz earned its reputation

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/05/us/trump-alcatraz-prison-history-hnk)
- _Published: 2025-05-05 09:09:00-20:09_

### Summary

President Donald Trump announced his intention to reopen Alcatraz, a notorious federal prison on a small island of the same name off the coast of San Francisco that once housed some of the country's most dangerous criminals. The prison, which has a storied history dating back to the 1850s and became a maximum-security facility in 1934, is set to be a symbol of 'Law, Order, and Justice.' Although the National Park Service manages Alcatraz as a popular tourist destination and historic landmark, current officials and the public generally oppose the President's plan to rebuild and reopen the prison. The prison's closure in 1963 was due to high maintenance costs and deteriorating infrastructure, which now requires millions to restore. However, the current status of Alcatraz as a national park with approximately 1.2 million visitors annually makes it difficult to justify reopening the facility under Trump's proposal, which the Bureau of Prisons has stated they will 'pursue all avenues' to implement.

### Summary

A phone app called TeleMessage, which was reportedly used by former U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz, has had its services suspended due to a security incident. The app, which preserves and organizes messages sent via Signal and other mobile apps, is now under investigation. A spokesperson for TeleMessage’s parent company, Smarsh, stated that all TeleMessage services have been temporarily suspended due to 'a recent security incident.' The extent of the hack is not clear, and there was no immediate response from TeleMessage regarding the data that may have been taken. TeleMessage, an app acquired by Smarsh in 2021, was used by Waltz, who is currently serving as a national security adviser under President Donald Trump. The suspension of TeleMessage services has raised concerns about the use of a potentially compromised app for sensitive communications. Joshua Steinman, a former cyber official at the National Security Council, commented that Waltz's use of the app could be a 'juicy intel target' for foreign powers, indicating potential intelligence risk. The National Security Council is yet to comment on Waltz's use of the app, and it has also been reported that Trump has announced Waltz's departure from his post as national security adviser to serve as the United Nations ambassador.

## Attacks on Harvard by Trump administration have built for months

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/04/26/us/harvard-university-trump-timeline)
- _Published: 2025-05-05 19:46:00+00:00_

### Summary

Since the Trump administration returned to power, it has made significant efforts to pressure universities, such as Harvard, to address antisemitism and political ideologies on campus. In January 2023, the administration issued an executive order calling for tougher enforcement of government efforts against antisemitism, followed by a multiagency Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism. This led to various actions, including the Department of Justice creating a Task Force, sending letters to Harvard, and demanding meetings. The Trump administration also threatened to cut off federal funding to universities, including Harvard, and launched investigations into the Harvard Law Review. Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security threatened to revoke Harvard's certification to participate in the Student and Exchange Visa Program, and the Internal Revenue Service made plans to rescind Harvard's tax-exempt status. Despite Harvard's legal challenges and defense of its First Amendment rights, the conflict between the administration and the university continued with more threats and actions being taken against Harvard, including the filing of a lawsuit against the administration, and the suspension of all new federal research grants to Harvard.

The list of names provided to potential jurors, which includes celebrities like Michael B.

## The REAL ID deadline is nearly here. Here’s what TSA wants you to know

- _Published: 2025-05-05 19:02:00-04:00_

### Summary

The REAL ID Act, which was passed in 2005 by Congress and enacted with the goal of enhancing security standards for identification, is set to take effect on May 7, 2025. This deadline, which has been repeatedly pushed back due to concerns from states and the travel industry, requires that all state-issued driver's licenses and identification cards meet minimum security standards for access to federal facilities, boarding aircraft, and entry into nuclear power plants. While passports remain an acceptable alternative for international travel, the REAL ID Act mandates that domestic air travel, access to federal facilities, and boarding aircraft will require a compliant identification. TSA, the Transportation Security Administration, is encouraging compliance among travelers and is working with various stakeholders to facilitate this transition. TSA has begun a public awareness campaign and is committed to enforcing the REAL ID regulations from the start of May 7. While some states are meeting the requirements faster than others, the costs and documentation requirements vary from place to place, with some states imposing additional requirements. For example, in Washington, DC, a REAL ID costs $47, while Pennsylvania charges a one-time $30 REAL ID fee and a $39.50 fee for drivers seeking a renewal, totaling $69.50 for a renewal. The deadline for compliance is not just May 7 but includes a timeframe where travelers can plan their summer and holiday travel to ensure they have the correct identification for their trips.

## Trump administration argues to keep window short for alleged Tren de Aragua detainees to challenge removal

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/05/politics/hearing-tren-de-aragua-detainees)
- _Published: 2025-05-05 18:31:00-20:31_

### Summary

In a Pennsylvania federal court hearing, the Trump administration argued that a detainee shouldn't be sent to the Salvadoran prison CECOT under the Alien Enemies Act, a law that allows for the removal of citizens or non-citizens of a country at war with the US. Justice Department lawyer Michael Velchik stated that the detainee's status could change if the administration believes he is affiliated with the gang Tren de Aragua, but he refused to specify if that would happen. The Justice Department claims there's no one currently in Pennsylvania planned for removal under the Alien Enemies Act. The ACLU and other organizations argue that this use of the act is a violation of due process, as detainees are not given sufficient notice and time to challenge their removal. Federal Judge Stephanie Haines, who is both a Trump appointee and a judge considering challenges to the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act, is expected to rule on this matter. The administration has proposed very short windows of time for detainees to challenge their removal under the act, with some suggesting a maximum of 12-24 hours.

### Summary

Georgia Governor Brian Kemp has decided not to run for the U.S. Senate in the 2026 election cycle, which could be a significant blow to Republican efforts to maintain their majority in the chamber. This decision comes after months of lobbying efforts by Republican leaders, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who expressed disappointment at Kemp's decision. The governor announced his decision on Monday, citing a desire to be 'with them' in supporting a strong Republican nominee in the race against Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff, and his commitment to working alongside Republican leadership. The announcement has led to speculation and plans for other Republican candidates to run for Senate, such as Chris Sununu, who previously passed on a bid and is now considering other races, and Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has not ruled out a run. This decision marks the end of speculation about Kemp's potential candidacy and leaves Democrats and Republican leaders with a renewed focus on the race against Ossoff.

## Ford doesn’t expect tariffs to cause significant price hikes for its cars

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/05/business/ford-says-auto-tariffs-will-cost-it-usd1-5-billion-in-rest-of-2025)
- _Published: 2025-05-05 17:51:00+00:00_

### Summary

In a statement from Ford's first-quarter earnings report, the automaker reassured that the tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump's administration would not cause significant price hikes for consumers. CEO Sherry House confirmed that the overall price increase for US cars would be minimal, expected to be between 1% to 1.5% in the second half of 2025. Ford anticipates that this increase would be due to the costs associated with tariffs on both imported cars and auto parts, which would need to be offset by the automaker. However, Ford CFO Sherry House also noted that the company expects a sharp overall drop in auto sales later this year, due to the rush to buy vehicles before the tariffs went into effect in April. Ford is expected to face fewer tariff effects than General Motors, which predicted a possible $4 billion to $5 billion impact. The automaker announced it will not provide a full-year earnings guidance due to the uncertainty caused by the tariffs.

## A Soviet-era spacecraft that failed to reach Venus is due to crash back to Earth this week

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/05/science/cosmos-482-reentry-earth)
- _Published: 2025-05-05 17:46:00-20:46_

### Summary

A piece of Soviet space debris, Cosmos 482, is expected to reenter Earth's atmosphere in the coming week, likely causing minimal risk to those on the ground. Despite the uncertainty surrounding its exact shape, size, and specific reentry part, the object is believed to have a heat shield that could help it survive the process. However, if it does reach the ground, the risk is estimated to be approximately 1 in 25,000. Experts from the Soviet Space Research Institute and The Aerospace Corporation provided detailed insights, suggesting that the object might be a reentry capsule designed to land on Venus. While the risks are low, safety guidelines advise that if the object does land, bystanders should avoid contacting it to prevent potential harm.

### Summary

In a social media post, President Donald Trump directed the Bureau of Prisons to rebuild and reopen Alcatraz prison as a place to 'house America’s most ruthless and violent offenders.' Trump claims he is responding to 'radicalized judges' who want due process for deportees, but former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized the proposal, stating it is not a serious one. The prison, which closed in 1963 due to high maintenance costs, has since been operated as a tourist destination and is now a National Historic Landmark. The Department of Justice and Bureau of Prisons are working to implement Trump's plan, but there are concerns about the high costs of reopening Alcatraz and the historical significance of the site as a national park.

### Summary

OpenAI, facing criticism and legal challenges, announced it would maintain its nonprofit parent control while restructuring its for-profit arm for capital-raising. The company's nonprofit parent will control the public benefit corporation, and become a major shareholder. This move came in response to a storm of criticism, including a high-profile lawsuit filed by rival Elon Musk, who accused the company of straying from its founding mission to develop AI for the benefit of humanity. OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, described the decision as a compromise that investors are happy with. The company had outlined plans in December to revamp its structure to become a public benefit corporation, saying that would help it to 'raise more capital than we’d imagined,' and remove the restrictions imposed on the startup by its current nonprofit parent. The change in structure could hinder OpenAI's ability to raise capital aggressively, according to some analysts.

### Summary

Brendan Carr, the top communications regulator at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), clarified that the investigation into '60 Minutes' by the FCC is a 'penalty' under the Communications Act, not a threat to the broadcaster. Carr stated that he views the investigation as a necessary action to protect the public interest by addressing what he calls 'news distortion,' particularly by larger broadcasters. He emphasized that the FCC is trying to counteract the control larger networks have over local TV stations, which he believes is at the root of declining trust in the media. Carr's stance is in contrast to past actions where the FCC has taken stronger measures against CBS, such as revoking its license. He also addressed the ongoing investigation into CBS's parent company, Paramount, and asserted that the FCC's actions are separate from the merger probe.

- _Published: 2025-05-05 14:42:00-04:00_

### Summary

The US Army has suspended helicopter flight operations into the Pentagon following two aborted landings at Reagan National Airport due to an Army Black Hawk helicopter approaching the Pentagon helipad. The incident occurred following the January 29 midair collision of American Airlines Flight 5342 and an Army Black Hawk helicopter, in which 67 people died. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) are investigating the incident, and the Army is committed to aviation safety and following approved procedures. The Army's 12th Aviation Battalion, which includes the helicopter involved, is under scrutiny. The proximity of the first aircraft, Delta Flight 1671, to the helicopter was 0.89 miles and 400 feet, while the second aircraft, Republic 5825, came within 0.4 miles and 200 feet of the helicopter. The collision occurred under clear skies, with investigators suggesting possible issues like an inaccurate altimeter and potential miscommunication between the pilots and the control tower. The FAA and NTSB have banned helicopter traffic on a four-mile stretch over the Potomac River following the January incident. A preliminary FAA report indicated the helicopter in question was not in a restricted area put in place after the January crash. The Army has expressed concerns about the significant potential for future midair collisions and has considered alternative methods of transportation like ground transportation as a safer option.

- _Published: 2025-05-05 14:17:00.000Z_

### Summary

About 4 million, or roughly one in five, federal student loan borrowers with a payment due are seriously delinquent, according to a new analysis from TransUnion. This represents a significant increase from 2.6 million in February 2020, just before the start of the pandemic. The article notes that while 50.8% of subprime borrowers are seriously delinquent, just 0.9% of those with super prime credit scores are behind. The findings come as the Department of Education has restarted collecting federal student loans in default following a Covid-era pause. TransUnion warns that the problem may be underreported due to borrowers exploring repayment programs. The article mentions that falling behind on student loan debt is costly, impacting credit scores and making it harder for borrowers to get mortgages and favorable interest rates. Tyler Wickord, a 29-year-old struggling with $12,000 in student loan debt, shares his personal experience of the financial difficulties faced by many student loan borrowers.

## Scientists explore the anatomy of a ‘zombie volcano’ that’s showing signs of activity

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/05/science/uturuncu-zombie-volcano-erupt)
- _Published: 2025-05-05 14:10:00-20:10_

### Summary

Scientists have explored the anatomy of a 'zombie volcano' named Uturuncu, a 250,000-year-old mountain in the Central Andes range, which is showing signs of activity. The research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, combined satellite data, seismic activity, and computer models to uncover the cause of the volcano's unrest. It revealed that magma, gases, and briny fluids were interacting within a hydrothermal network, not surging magma, leading to quakes, steam release, and volcano deformation. The study found that as the magma body heated subterranean liquid and released gases, the gas and liquid migrated upward and collected in chambers below the volcanic crater. The findings suggest that Uturuncu's activity is not a sign of an imminent eruption, but rather a 'zombie' volcano degassing, letting off steam. The research has implications for understanding volcanoes, identifying potential targets for geothermal energy, and accessing minerals essential for technology. The study was conducted using multiple techniques, including seismic activity, rock chemistry, and physics analysis, to create a clearer picture of the volcano's internal structure.

## Skechers is going private during the middle of a trade war

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/05/business/skechers-shoes-3g-capital)
- _Published: 2025-05-05 15:59:00-04:00_

### Summary

Skechers, a shoe company based in Southern California with 5,300 US stores, is planning to go private by being purchased by investment firm 3G Capital for $9.4 billion. CEO Robert Greenberg of Skechers stated in a statement that the company is entering 'its next chapter in partnership with the global investment firm 3G Capital.' The move to go private comes amid a trade war during which President Trump's tariffs have heavily impacted the footwear industry. Skechers' stock jumped 25% on the news of the acquisition. The company is getting off the public market due to the influence of tariffs, which have made it more attractive to be taken private. Other struggling companies may consider similar moves in the future as a response to volatility. Sneakers, which are 99% manufactured overseas, are highly exposed to tariffs, and Skechers, being an American shoe company, has seen its share prices fall due to fears of the impact of tariffs on its operations. Skechers previously withdrew its financial guidance due to the uncertainty around tariffs, and other companies in the footwear industry have urged the president to exempt the footwear industry from tariffs.

## Marijuana is extremely dangerous to the fetus in the womb, study finds

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/05/health/marijuana-prenatal-harm-wellness)
- _Published: 2025-05-05 12:49:00.000-04:00_

### Summary

A new meta-analysis of research has found that using marijuana during pregnancy is linked to poor fetal development, low infant birth weight, dangerously early deliveries, and even death. The analysis, led by Dr. Jamie Lo, an obstetrician at Oregon Health & Science University, and published in JAMA Pediatrics, analyzed 51 studies with over 21 million participants. The findings indicate that use of marijuana during pregnancy is associated with a 52% higher risk of preterm delivery before 37 weeks and a 75% higher risk of low birth weight. The study also found a 29% higher risk of infant death associated with the use of marijuana during pregnancy. Despite the potential harms, marijuana use during pregnancy is rising, and there is a misconception that it is harmless due to its natural origins. The new research suggests that as more studies are conducted with consistent results, there is more certainty that there is an association between prenatal exposure to cannabis and adverse birth outcomes. Experts also highlight the risks of cognitive decline and dementia, complications during surgery, cancers, and mental disorders in children of marijuana users.

## Temu says it’s only shipping from the US. That doesn’t mean the products are made here

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/03/business/temu-shipping-us-china-de-minimis-tariffs)
- _Published: 2025-05-05 06:01:00+00:00_

### Summary

Chinese e-commerce site Temu announced that all its American sales would now be handled by US-based sellers, fulfilling orders from within the US. This marks a significant shift, as the platform had previously used the de minimis exemption to flood the US market with low-cost goods. The de minimis loophole allowed shipments of goods worth $800 or less to enter the US duty-free, often bypassing time-consuming inspections and paperwork. With the Trump administration imposing tariffs on all Chinese imports, Temu's new model shows how major companies could evade these tariffs and adopt alternative strategies. The site will now fulfill orders from local warehouses, but the products may not be made in the USA, as they are often manufactured in China and imported directly to the US. Temu claims that its pricing for US consumers remains unchanged as the platform transitions to a local fulfillment model. However, some customers have reported that items are out of stock or subject to additional fees. The change is a response to the Trump administration's tariffs, the de minimis exemption being used by Chinese e-commerce sites to gain a competitive edge in the US market.

## Trump orders a 100% tariff on foreign movies

- _Published: 2025-05-05 05:40:00+00:00_

### Summary

President Donald Trump has ordered the Commerce Department and US Trade Representative to impose a 100% tariff on foreign films produced and imported into the United States. Trump believes that other countries are offering incentives to draw American filmmakers away from the U.S. He suggests that this is a national security threat and a form of messaging and propaganda. The tariff announcement comes as the movie industry in the U.S. is struggling due to a decrease in the number of major pictures hitting theaters and a shift towards streaming services. However, the implementation of such a tariff is unclear as films are intellectual property and not traditionally subject to tariffs. The USTR notes that some services, including film production, could be subject to certain non-tariff trade barriers, which could potentially disadvantage American filmmaking.

### Key Takeaways

## What We Know About the Massive Staffing Shortage Causing 7 Days of Major Delays at Newark Airport

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/04/us/newark-airport-nj-united-flights-delays)
- _Published: 2025-05-05 03:48:00-04:00_

### Summary

For years, the shortage of certified air traffic controllers in the U.S. has led to flight disruptions and headaches for travelers across the country. This issue has been particularly problematic at busy Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, where staffing issues have led to major delays for an unprecedented seventh day in a row. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Sunday implemented a Ground Delay Program and flights were delayed an average of almost four hours Sunday evening. The reasons for these delays include a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, a walk-off by Newark air traffic controllers, the closure of a runway for rehabilitation work, and technology failures caused by outdated equipment. Newark Airport's control facility responsible for traffic has been 'chronically understaffed for years,' and the shortage is at its lowest point in nearly 30 years. The FAA is using delays to slow the number of flights so the system remains safe, and the President is calling for Congress to provide the resources needed to upgrade the technology. The controllers union, flight attendants, and airlines are calling for more air traffic controllers and better technology to mitigate the delays and ensure safety for travelers.

## Children aged 14 or younger now make up less than 12% of this country’s population

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/05/asia/japan-child-population-fall-intl-hnk)
- _Published: 2025-05-05 12:20:00-13:20_

### Summary

Japan's estimated child population has decreased for the 44th straight year, standing at a record low of 13.66 million children aged 14 and under as of April 1, 2025, representing just 11.1% of the total population of 123.4 million. This demographic crisis is attributed to a falling birth rate and a rapidly aging population. The fertility rate remains at 1.3, significantly below the 2.1 required to maintain a stable population. The government has launched initiatives such as expanding child care facilities and offering housing subsidies to boost fertility rates and incentivize marriage. However, Japan is described as a 'super-aged' nation with more than 20% of the population over the age of 65, and the total population is expected to drop to about 88 million by 2065. The article notes that several other East Asian and European countries, including China, South Korea, and Italy, have also experienced population decline, but Japan's unique approach focuses on fertility rates and family incentives, rather than embracing immigration as a solution.

### Key Takeaways
  - Japan's child population has decreased for the 44th consecutive year, standing at a record low of 13.66 million children aged 14 or younger as of April 1, 2025, representing 11.1% of the total population of 123.4 million.
  - Japan's fertility rate has been relatively flat at 1.3 in recent years, falling short of the 2.1 required to maintain a stable population.
  - The falling birth rate and aging population have become a significant concern for Japan, leading to a workforce decline, economic challenges, and changes in social structures.
  - Japan is described as a 'super-aged' nation with more than 20% of the population over the age of 65, with projections indicating that the population may drop to about 88 million in 2065.
  - Demographic factors influencing the decrease in Japan's child population include high living costs, a weak yen, economic stagnation, high inflation, a demanding work culture, and limited housing availability.
  - Government efforts to address the issue have included launching initiatives such as expanding child care facilities, offering housing subsidies to parents, and paying couples to have children.
  - Several other East Asian and European countries, including China, South Korea, and Italy, have also experienced population decline, but Japan's approach to the issue is somewhat unique in its focus on fertility rates and family incentives, compared to other countries that have embraced immigration as a solution.

## Americans still don’t know how and when to wash their hands

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/05/health/handwashing-habits-survey-wellness)
- _Published: 2025-05-05 12:01:00-20:01_

### Summary

A recent survey conducted by the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases has found that nearly half of the respondents forget or choose not to wash their hands at key times, such as after visiting grocery stores, restaurants, coffee shops, and health care settings. Despite the lessons learned during the pandemic, 33% of participants say they now wash their hands more frequently than they did during the crisis. The survey highlighted that only 30% of adults wash their hands after sneezing or coughing, which is concerning due to the potential spread of respiratory diseases. The survey also found that older adults and men are the least likely to wash their hands at important times. Dr. Robert Hopkins from the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases emphasized the importance of hand hygiene in reducing the spread of infectious diseases, stating that it is a 'nonspecific way that we can reduce risk for exposure to infectious diseases, along with dirt, grime [and] all of the other things we don’t like to see on our hands.'

### Key Takeaways
  - Some Americans still do not follow the recommended practice of handwashing, even after the pandemic.
  - Only 30% of respondents reported washing their hands after sneezing or coughing, which is concerning.

- _Published: 2025-05-05 06:00:00-04:00_

### Summary

CNN's analysis by Stephen Collinson highlights how President Donald Trump is acting outside of the constitutional limits set for him. In a recent NBC interview, Trump said he doesn't 'need to uphold' the Constitution, a statement that has raised concerns about his adherence to the law. His actions, such as defying federal courts and executive orders, have been seen as attempts to defy traditional norms of presidential behavior. Trump's behavior, including his aggressive stance on trade, border security, and foreign policy, has been criticized as potentially leading to authoritarianism. His administration's repeated defiance of legal processes, like the Supreme Court, suggests a shift towards a more powerful and less constrained presidency. The article also notes that his Cabinet members are willing to go along with his agenda, and that Republican members of Congress are becoming increasingly concerned with his actions, even as they publicly support his policies.

### Key Takeaways
  - Trump is acting in a way that is seen as ignoring constitutional constraints, showing a lack of respect for legal processes.

The US President also mentioned the island's rich resources, including oil, gas, and rare earth metals, which could be accessed due to climate change. Despite Denmark's and Greenland's rejection of such annexation, Trump's statements have raised concerns and tensions, especially following Canada’s victory in the federal elections.

## Trump says he would extend TikTok deadline if no deal reached by June 19

- [source](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/04/business/trump-tiktok-deadline-june-19)
- _Published: 2025-05-04 10:13:00+00:00_

### Summary

U.S. President Donald Trump has stated his intention to extend the June 19 deadline for ByteDance to divest U.S. assets of TikTok, the short video app used by 170 million Americans, if no deal had been reached by then. He cited the impact of 145% tariffs on Chinese goods on China's economy. Trump has already twice granted a reprieve from the congressionally mandated ban on TikTok, initially due to take effect in January, and the deal that had been in the works would have spun off TikTok’s U.S. operations into a new firm based in the United States and majority-owned and operated by U.S. investors but was put on hold after China indicated it would not approve it following Trump’s announcements of steep tariffs on Chinese goods. The extension of the deadline was seen as a move to protect TikTok from the potential ban and to maintain a favorable position for the app during the 2024 presidential election. Democratic senators argue that Trump has no legal authority to extend the deadline and suggest that the deal that had been under consideration would not meet legal requirements.

## Trump restricts funding for 'gain-of-function' research — calling it dangerous

- [source](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5267612)
- _Published: 2025-05-05 19:49:00-04:00_

### Summary

President Trump issued an executive order on May 5, 2025, restricting federal funding for 'gain-of-function' or 'dual-use' research in the United States. This controversial area of scientific study involves experimenting with viruses and pathogens, which could potentially lead to the creation of more dangerous pathogens that could cause pandemics. The executive order aims to provide powerful tools to enforce the ban on federal funding for gain-of-function research abroad and strengthens other oversight mechanisms related to this issue. Despite concerns about the broadness of the funding restriction, which could stifle safe research, many scientists argue that better oversight is needed to prevent and respond to future pandemics. The order blocks any U.S. funding of gain-of-function research in countries of concern, such as China and Iran, and prohibits U.S. dollars from contributing to foreign research likely to cause another pandemic. Supporters of the executive order, including Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya, believe it increases the safety and security of biological research without impeding U.S. innovation.

## States sue Trump administration for blocking the development of wind energy

- [source](https://text.npr.org/g-s1-64393)
- _Published: 2025-05-05 17:45:00-20:45_

### Summary

A coalition of 17 states and Washington, D.C. filed a lawsuit against President Trump's executive order, signed during his first day in office, to stop the development of wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. The states argue that Trump has no authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process and that the move is jeopardizing their economic vitality and climate goals. The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts. The Trump administration, in contrast, claims that the Biden administration's policies are the problem, as Biden has supported wind energy, while Trump's policies have been more aggressive against wind energy development, aiming to boost fossil fuels and reduce domestic energy production. The lawsuit aims to declare the executive order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it, arguing that it contradicts the Biden administration's goals and contradicts Trump's own declaration of a 'national energy emergency' to expand domestic energy production.

## Trump administration asks court to toss suit restricting access to abortion drug

- [source](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5388198)
- _Published: 2025-05-06 01:20:00-20:20_

### Summary

The Trump administration filed a request to dismiss a lawsuit filed by three Republican-led states seeking to restrict access to the abortion medication mifepristone via telehealth. The Department of Justice argued the states lack legal standing to sue, citing the time limit to file such a claim. The case, originally filed after the Supreme Court's decision to preserve access to mifepristone, is being considered by U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk in Texas. Kacsmaryk, a Trump nominee, previously ruled in favor of halting approval for the drug in a lawsuit filed by anti-abortion groups. The states argue that the FDA should prohibit telehealth prescriptions, require in-office visits, and restrict the use of mifepristone in pregnancy. The Trump administration's stance aligns with his past statements opposing restrictions on abortion medication, such as his decision to appoint justices to the Supreme Court who had the majority in overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022.

- [source](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5387239)
- _Published: 2025-05-05 16:03:00-20:03_

### Summary

President Donald Trump has announced plans to rebuild and reopen Alcatraz, a notorious maximum security prison that closed over 60 years ago, to house the 'most ruthless and violent' offenders. Historically, Alcatraz served as a prison for dangerous criminals and was seen as a symbol of the government's commitment to addressing crime and public safety. However, the proposal to reopen the prison is met with skepticism due to its high costs and logistical challenges, including water and sewage issues. The National Park Service and the Federal Bureau of Prisons have been referred for comment on the feasibility of the plan. As a result, the decision to reopen Alcatraz would require addressing both historical and modern-day challenges associated with maintaining a prison on an island.

### Key Takeaways

## Minor infractions lead to big problems for international students

- [source](https://text.npr.org/g-s1-64338)
- _Published: 2025-05-05 16:08:00-20:00_

### Summary

Thousands of international students were told they had lost permission to study and work in the U.S. and would likely have to leave, including this man, who recently got his master's degree at the University of South Florida. His troubles apparently started with a minor traffic violation a few years ago, when he was charged with failing to yield to a police officer. In court, the man explained he had been waiting for a safe place to pull off the highway. But that single dismissed charge has now upended his life. His student visa registration allowed him to continue his training and work. That was abruptly terminated last month, forcing him to resign from his first job at the Florida Department of Revenue. The man, who has joined a lawsuit with other international students, believes his troubles began with a minor traffic violation a few years ago and was forced to resign from his job. Starting in March, officials at ICE ran the names of more than 1 million international students through the National Crime Information Center, a federal database that tracks crime-related information. ICE came up with about 6,400 likely hits and then used that data to terminate thousands of SEVIS records. The problem, immigration lawyers say, is that many of those hits were for minor brushes with the law, including traffic offenses, or cases where charges were later dropped or dismissed by police and courts. The Trump administration confirmed in court that it terminated immigration records for thousands of international students because of past encounters with law enforcement, causing significant confusion and legal issues for these students.

- _Published: 2025-05-05 05:00:00-04:00_

### Summary

The Trump administration has shut down the office responsible for leading the Safe to Sleep campaign, a public awareness effort launched in 1994 to reduce infant mortality rates from sleep-related causes. This shutdown, occurring on April 1, 2025, comes at a time when sleep-related infant deaths have risen by nearly 12% since 2020. The campaign, originally called Back to Sleep, has previously seen significant success, reducing deaths from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) by 50%. Since its termination, no final decision has been made regarding the future of the Safe to Sleep campaign. However, materials are still available online. The discontinuation of the campaign has raised concerns among researchers and organizations like First Candle, which hopes to continue educating parents on safe sleep recommendations but lacks the funding to replace the resources provided by the NIH. This situation has led to an increase in the number of parents not receiving the necessary information on safe sleep practices, potentially leading to increased risk of infant deaths.

## 'Supermarket displays of oranges will never look the same after reading 'Foreign Fruit''

- [source](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5377392)
- _Published: 2025-05-05 14:54:00.000Z_

### Summary

In her memoir 'Foreign Fruit: A Personal History of the Orange,' author Katie Goh uses the citrus fruit as a metaphor to explore her own complex identity and connections to various cultures and histories. Goh, a queer person of Chinese, Malaysian, and Irish heritage, weaves personal and historical narratives, tracing the global journey of the orange from its origin in China to its presence in various European empires. Her memoir also reflects on her personal travels and family history, mirroring her own family tree and experiences in relation to British colonization. The author's journey-oriented structure, however, can be limiting as it restricts sustained reflection, and her final chapter is interrupted by celebratory fireworks, preventing a deeper meditation on the shooting incident in California. The book offers a unique lens through which readers can view the fruit, challenging their understanding of it.

## Skype, the pioneering online video calling service, will shut down on 2025-05-05.

- [source](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5387436)
- _Published: 2025-05-05 15:39:00-04:00_

### Summary

Skype, the pioneering online video calling service that has been around for over two decades, will shut down entirely on 2025-05-05. Microsoft, which owns Skype, announced in February that the service would be available until May 5 and urged users to switch to the free version of Microsoft Teams, its communication platform with video call capabilities. Microsoft claims Skype users can automatically migrate all of their chats and contacts to Teams. However, the user base has been dwindling in recent years due to competition from other video calling and messaging alternatives such as Zoom, WhatsApp, and Slack. The service has been available since 2003, founded by Niklas Zennström and Janus Friis, who began with offering phone calls over the internet. By 2005, eBay had acquired Skype for $2.6 billion, which later was sold to a group of investors in 2009, who in turn sold Skype to Microsoft. Despite its decline, Microsoft suggests that users can migrate their accounts to Teams, making the transition seamless.
